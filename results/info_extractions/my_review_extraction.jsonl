The seƫng is spectacular and the premise is invenƟve. \n \nOn every other front,the movie falters badly. Once you get over the iniƟal wonderment surrounding the \nbeauƟful visuals, the chinks start showing up. Overall the script is very weak. Apparently the Russians \nbomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed, smashing everything \nin its way. Now upon hearing an emergency evacuaƟon request, Kowalski (who has been wasƟng his \nprecious thrusters all this while, floaƟng around, spouƟng inane dialogs) orders Ryan (Bullock) to \ndisengage from whatever she is repairing. Apparently Ryan has six months of training (only) and fails to \nbe responsive and then the trouble starts. \n \nWe come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer \nfelt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existenƟal problem in her head to make her character feel \nmore human. Apart from this minor bit, nothing is presented in terms of character development for any \nother protagonists. Who is Kowalski? Who are the people who died in their space pods? No idea. \n \nThen the whole manufactured sense of suspense. Every Ɵme Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock (she \ndoes it three Ɵmes), the debris presents itself like on cue every single Ɵme. Then a fire in a space staƟon, \nthen running out of Oxygen, then something then something. It's fine that they used some standard \ntricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense. \n \nAlso at Ɵmes I couldn't shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual. \nDo the controls on various internaƟonal space staƟons have their naƟonal languages on them? Really? \nMaybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20$ phones are built with custom User interfaces with \nchangeable languages, why have your billion dollar space staƟons with Russian or Chinese characters on \nyour butons totally beats me. Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can't-understand-this-\nthing machinery. \n \nThe the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about. Ryan has a hallucinatory moment \nwhen she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chater on the radio which is cringe worthy. I wont \neven menƟon the in-your-face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper \nthan it is. \n \nSo what works for the movie? It's a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements \nthrown it which makes it look path breaking. \n \nBut it's not. Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either. \nFrom: htps://www.imdb.com/Ɵtle/t1454468/reviews/\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_503209f6"}
