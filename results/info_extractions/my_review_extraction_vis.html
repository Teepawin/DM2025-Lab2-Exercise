<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Visually, Gravity is unlike what we have seen on a cinema screen before</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">arguably it has one of the 
best uses of 3D in a movie</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The</span> seƫng is spectacular and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the premise is</span> invenƟve. 

On every other front,the movie falters badly. Once you get over the iniƟal wonderment surrounding the 
beauƟful visuals, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the chinks start showing up</span>. Overall <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the script is very weak</span>. Apparently the Russians 
bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed, smashing everything 
in its way. Now upon hearing an emergency evacuaƟon request, Kowalski (who has been wasƟng his 
precious thrusters all this while, floaƟng around, spouƟng inane dialogs) orders Ryan (Bullock) to 
disengage from whatever she is repairing. Apparently Ryan has six months of training (only) and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">fails to 
be responsive</span> and then the trouble starts. 

We come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the writer 
felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of</span> existenƟal problem in her head to make her character feel 
more human. Apart from this minor bit, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">nothing is presented in terms of character development for any 
other protagonists</span>. Who is Kowalski? Who are the people who died in their space pods? No idea. 

Then <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the whole manufactured sense of suspense</span>. Every Ɵme Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock (she 
does it three Ɵmes), the debris presents itself like on cue every single Ɵme. Then a fire in a space staƟon, 
then running out of Oxygen, then something then something. It&#x27;s fine that they used some standard 
tricks but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense</span>. 

Also at Ɵmes <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I couldn&#x27;t shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Do the controls on various</span> internaƟonal space staƟons have their naƟonal languages on them? Really? 
Maybe they do but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">seems hard to believe</span> when 20$ phones are built with custom User interfaces with 
changeable languages, why have your billion dollar space staƟons with Russian or Chinese characters on 
your butons <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">totally beats me</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Oh manufactured suspense</span> owing to the whole can&#x27;t-understand-this-
thing machinery. 

The <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ryan has a hallucinatory moment 
when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chater on the radio which is cringe worthy</span>. I wont 
even menƟon the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">in-your-face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper 
than it is</span>. 

So what works for the movie? <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It&#x27;s a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements 
thrown it which makes it look path breaking</span>. 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">But it&#x27;s not.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either.</span>
